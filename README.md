README: Quantitative Analysis Using PyNance and TA-Lib
Overview
This task focuses on performing a quantitative analysis of stock price data using PyNance and TA-Lib. The objective is to enhance your understanding of financial metrics and technical indicators to gain insights into stock market behavior.

Objectives
Load and Prepare Financial Data: Use additional finance data to analyze stock prices, ensuring all necessary data columns (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) are included.
Apply Technical Analysis Indicators: Use TA-Lib to compute various technical indicators, such as Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
Compute Financial Metrics: Leverage PyNance to calculate additional financial metrics and gain deeper insights.
Visualize Data: Create informative visualizations to better understand stock price trends and the impact of different technical indicators.
Tasks
Data Loading and Preparation:

Load your stock price data into a pandas DataFrame.
Ensure the DataFrame includes all necessary columns: Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
Clean the data by handling any missing or incorrect values.
Apply Technical Indicators with TA-Lib:

Calculate various technical indicators using TA-Lib, such as:
Moving Averages: Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA).
Relative Strength Index (RSI): Measures the speed and change of price movements.
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Identifies changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.
Ensure the accuracy of the calculated indicators.
Use PyNance for Financial Metrics:

Utilize PyNance to compute additional financial metrics, such as volatility, Sharpe ratio, or beta.
Analyze the results to understand the performance and risk associated with different stocks.
Visualize the Data:

Create visualizations (line charts, bar charts, etc.) to represent the stock price data and technical indicators.
Ensure that the visualizations clearly show the impact of different indicators on stock prices.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Proactivity to Self-Learn: Share references and resources utilized during the task.
Accuracy of Indicators: Ensure all technical indicators and metrics are calculated correctly.
Completeness of Data Analysis: Conduct a thorough analysis, covering all necessary aspects of the task.
