This task aims to investigate the correlation between news sentiment and stock price movements. By aligning financial news headlines with stock prices and analyzing the sentiment of news articles, we can determine whether there is a significant relationship between the tone of news and stock market behavior.

Objectives
Date Alignment: Ensure that both datasets (news and stock prices) are correctly aligned by date to facilitate accurate correlation analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on news headlines to quantify the tone (positive, negative, neutral) using Python libraries like NLTK and TextBlob.
Stock Movement Analysis: Calculate daily stock returns by computing the percentage change in closing prices.
Correlation Analysis: Use statistical methods to test the correlation between daily news sentiment scores and stock returns.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Proactivity and Learning: Demonstrate initiative by exploring resources and techniques independently.
Sentiment Analysis Accuracy: Ensure that sentiment analysis is conducted correctly and effectively.
Correlation Strength: Identify the strength of the relationship between news sentiment and stock movements.
