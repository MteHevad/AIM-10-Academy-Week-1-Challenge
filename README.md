Financial News and Stock Market Analysis
This project aims to analyze a large corpus of financial news data to uncover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. It is designed to develop skills in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE). The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and quantitative analysis using financial data.

Project Overview
Task 1: Git and GitHub Setup
Setting up Python environment: Configure your Python environment for data analysis and development.
Git version control: Utilize Git for version control by creating branches and regularly committing your progress.
CI/CD: Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment workflows using GitHub Actions.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Dev environment setup.
Demonstration of relevant skills in Git and GitHub.
Continuous and descriptive commits to the repository.
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics:

Obtain basic statistics for textual lengths (e.g., headline length).
Count the number of articles per publisher to identify the most active ones.
Analyze publication dates to spot trends, like increased news frequency on specific days or during particular events.
Text Analysis (Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling):

Perform sentiment analysis on headlines to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract common keywords or phrases, identify significant topics or events.
Time Series Analysis:

Evaluate how the frequency of publication varies over time and identify spikes related to market events.
Analyze publication times to determine if there's a pattern, which can be crucial for trading strategies.
Publisher Analysis:

Identify which publishers contribute most frequently to the news feed.
Explore if certain organizations contribute more based on domain names in email addresses.
Task 3: Quantitative Analysis Using PyNance and TA-Lib
Prepare Financial Data:

Load and prepare stock price data into a pandas DataFrame, including columns like Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
Apply Analysis Indicators with TA-Lib:

Calculate technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).
Use PyNance for Financial Metrics:

Leverage PyNance to compute various financial metrics.
Visualize the Data:

Create visualizations to understand the data and the impact of different indicators on stock prices.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Proactivity to self-learn and share references.
Accuracy in the application of technical indicators.
Completeness and depth of data analysis.
Task 4: Correlation Analysis Between News and Stock Movements
Date Alignment:

Align news and stock price datasets by dates to ensure accurate comparison.
Sentiment Analysis:

Perform sentiment analysis on news headlines to assign sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral).
Correlation Analysis:

Calculate daily stock returns based on percentage changes in daily closing prices.
Test correlations between daily news sentiment scores and stock returns using statistical methods.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Demonstration of self-learning through shared references.
Quality and accuracy of sentiment analysis.
Strength of correlations determined between news sentiment and stock movements.
